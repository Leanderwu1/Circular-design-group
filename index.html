                            <p>Zippers often break easily for a variety of reasons, often caused by the user not being careful or simply being worn down over time. Our plan is meant to address this issue by making it so that anyone can easily repair a broken zipper so that the zipper does not need to be disacarded when it's broken</p>

                            <p>We can make repairs to specific parts of the zipper if one part breaks, replacing that section of the zipper. We sew a placement for each individual part on the shirt so we don't have to sew anything when we want to replace the section of the zipper.</p>

                            <p>Zippair solves the issue of zipper repair. It helps limit material consumption, allowing the user to repair a small segment of their zipper instead of the entire zipper or even the entire clothing item. Zippair does this using a slider track holder that is sewn into the clothing item itself. The zipper then slides into the holder. The zipper itself is segmented, allowing one segment individually to be replaced instead of the entire track.</p>

                            <p>Originally, our group intended to do a lost and found project that involved setting up a system where we were able to report and catalogue lost items. However, after much deliberation, we decided instead to settle on a zipper repair since we found it a more common issue, and a broken zipper would result in the total loss of a shirt/coat using zippers. We even had a storyboard for the project</p>

        The file was modified, and includes the zipper tracks extended so they can be glued to the slider track. The zipper pull, grip for the zipper pull, slider tracks, the slider track holders with sewing holes, the clips, and the bars for the clips are also included in this Fusion file. 
        <p> <p>
        Step 1: Slice these in two separate prints due to the size of the entire file. Slice with a raft underneath to prevent adhesion errors. Add supports on the clips and print using PLA filament.
        <p> <p>
        Step 2: Remove the raft and the supports of prints using pliers.
        <p> <p>
        Step 3: Superglue the zipper tracks and the slider tracks together, making sure to orient them correctly. To do this, lay out each side of the zipper with the zipper tracks and make sure the slider tracks are all being glued in the same direction.
        <p> <p>
        Step 4: Once dry, file down each end of these newly glued pieces in order for better glue adhesion.
        <p> <p>
        Step 5: Glue the clips and bars to the ends of each zipper track. Make sure to be orienting them correctly.
        <p> <p>
        Step 6: Sew (or glue) the slider track holders on your fabric or clothing item. Space them 2 inches apart vertically.
        <p> <p>
        Step 7: Slide in the zipper tracks and align the clips. This is the current extent of the Zippair prototype.   
        <h1 class="mt-5" style="color: #cdae51"><b>Next Steps</b></h1>
            <p> The extension of the zipper track prevents the zipper from bending, and therefore prevents it from being functional. It needs to be remolded so it can bend with the zipper teeth while also sliding into the base track. This would likely look like zipper teeth faced downward, molded to fit into the slider track holder, connected by a thinner rod that can bend. It still needs to be able to securely glue to the zipper track.
            <p> <p>
            The clips need to be remodeled so they actually function and clip together, as currently they're loose and only really meant to show such a concept could work.
            <p> <p>
            The surfaces need to be adjusted so they all fit together more perfectly, to prevent cold air from flowing in as a noral zipper would.
            <p> <p>
            If a functional 3D print model can be reached, material testing would be the next hurdle. Our ideal material would be some sort of metal, which for standard zipper material would be either brass, nickel or aluminum.
            <p> <p>
            Material testing would attempt to cast the model in metal. This would require professional level skills, and would also require more machinery and material that we currently lack both the skill and resources to obtain and operate.
